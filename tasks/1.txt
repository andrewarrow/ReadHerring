screenplay pdf files come in all sorts of format. But the basic elements are always the same.
There is a title page, then FADE IN: and then it alternates between NARRATOR lines and CHARACTER
lines. ultrathink a plan to take in a pdf, extract the text, and then correctly parse it.

The presents of \n and \t or spaces will be the way to know what things are.

CHARACTER dialog always starts with tabs or spaces to indent the name in the center of the page.

Make sure your plan does not rely on looking for common english words to know when a change between
CHARACTER and NARRATOR happens. It must use only the new lines, tabs, spaces. And it must work for
any screenplay not just one example. There are 3 examples here for you to test with: pointbreak.pdf,
fade.pdf, and anora.pdf
